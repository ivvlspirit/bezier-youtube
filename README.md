In this repository you can find two folders:
- Approximation
- Interpolation

The first one is the code for the [part one](https://youtu.be/GfPJ3Dw6GeY), the second one is for the [part two](https://youtu.be/AMJhfFIzT-k).

The code for the interpolation video uses the Jama package, which you can download [here](https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/).
